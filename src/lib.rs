//! 
//! A pure Rust audio digital signal processing library for Piston.
//!
//! There are two primary modules of interest within this library, both of which
//! are unrelated and are designed to be used separately.
//! 1. node.rs and the `Node` trait.
//! 2. graph.rs and the `Graph` type.
//!
//! The `Node` trait offers a DSP chaining design via its `inputs` method. It is
//! slightly simpler to use than the `Graph` type however also slightly more limited.
//! Using the `Node` trait, it is impossible for two nodes to reference the same
//! input `Node` making it difficult to perform "bussing" and "side-chaining".
//!
//! The `Graph` type constructs a directed, acyclic graph of DSP nodes. It is
//! the recommended approach for more advanced DSP chains that involve things like
//! "bussing", "side-chaining" or more DAW-esque behaviour. The `Graph` type requires
//! its nodes to have implemented the `Dsp` trait (a slightly simplified version of the
//! `Node` trait, though entirely unrelated). Internally, `Graph` uses bluss's petgraph
//! crate. See more [here](https://crates.io/crates/petgraph).
